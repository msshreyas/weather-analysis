## üìä Target Variable Selection Strategy

### For Different Objectives:

| **Objective** | **Best Target** | **Rationale** |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Public Health** | PM2.5 | Direct health impact, policy relevance |
| **Transportation** | Visibility | Safety-critical operations |
| **General Weather** | Condition Classification | Universal applicability |
| **Agriculture** | Humidity + UV Index | Crop growth conditions |
| **Energy** | Wind Speed + Temperature | Renewable energy + demand |
| **Climate Research** | Multiple targets | Comprehensive understanding |

## üéØ Recommended Modeling Approach

### 1. **Start with PM2.5 (Regression)**
```python
target = 'air_quality_PM2.5'
features = ['temperature_celsius', 'humidity', 'pressure_mb', 
           'wind_kph', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'hour', 'month']
```

### 2. **Follow with Visibility (Regression)**
```python
target = 'visibility_km'
features = ['humidity', 'air_quality_PM2.5', 'wind_kph', 
           'precip_mm', 'temperature_celsius']
```

### 3. **Then Weather Classification (Multi-class)**
```python
target = 'condition_text'
features = ['temperature_celsius', 'humidity', 'pressure_mb', 
           'wind_kph', 'precip_mm', 'cloud', 'uv_index']
```

- Elevation (if available)
- Urban vs rural classification
- Population density

### Temporal Features
- Season indicators
- Holiday/weekend flags
- Time since sunrise/sunset

### Interaction Features
- Temperature √ó Humidity (heat index)
- Wind √ó Pressure (weather system strength)
- Latitude √ó Month (seasonal effects)

## üö´ Targets to Avoid

### **Temperature_celsius** (Already used)
- Too highly correlated with feels_like_celsius (r=0.998)
- May lead to data leakage

### **Pressure_in / Temperature_fahrenheit**
- Redundant unit conversions
- No additional information

### **Astronomical Data** (sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset)
- Deterministic based on location and date
- Not suitable for predictive modeling
